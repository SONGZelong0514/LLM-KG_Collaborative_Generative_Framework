## Phase 2. **Constraint Analysis**

Below is a restatement and brief analysis of all provided constraints:

1. All operations have prerequisites that must be finished first.  
2. “S40_00001_Jig in” and “S40_01001_Set up working environment” must be the first two operations, and “S40_00002_Jig out” is the final operation of the entire plan. Each is executed only once.  
3. One 1/4 fuselage joint is completed by either “S40_04012_Deburring int, positioning, attach them automatic” or “S40_04013_Deburring int, positioning, attach them manual,” both of which require their prerequisite chain to be completed first.  
4. Automatic joint operations can only be carried out in series (one 1/4 body at a time).  
5. Manual joint operations can be done in series or in parallel—up to two sets at once.  
6. No manual operation may be done in parallel with any automatic operation, and only the same manual operations can be parallelized. Different manual tasks cannot run concurrently.  
7. After performing “S40_04014_Deinstall LFT and rails” or “S40_04013_Deburring int, positioning, attach them manual,” the subsequent two steps must be “S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant” followed by “S40_02003_Inspection.”  
8. If multiple 1/4 bodies are manually jointed (series or parallel), “S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant” and “S40_02003_Inspection” only need to be done once at the end of those manual joints.  
9. If multiple 1/4 bodies are automatically jointed in series, only one execution of “S40_02001_Set in position Rails and LFT” is needed at the start, and one execution of “S40_04014_Deinstall LFT and rails” is needed at the end of that automatic batch.

### Automatic vs. Manual Quarter Joint Logic

• Automatic Joint Flow (per 1/4 body), minimally:  
  – (shared start) S40_02001_Set in position Rails and LFT → S40_04001_Camera at stating holes → S40_04012_Deburring int…(auto) → (shared end) S40_04014_Deinstall LFT and rails → then S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant → S40_02003_Inspection.  

• Manual Joint Flow (per 1/4 body), one example chain:  
  – S40_04003_Drilling template install → S40_04004_Fixation drilling template suite manual → S40_04005_Drilling (with adapter) → S40_04006_Deinstall drilling template → S40_04007_Set in position temporary fastener → S40_04013_Deburring int…(manual) → then at final, S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant → S40_02003_Inspection.

## Phase 3. **Plan Generation**

Below is a proposed plan covering four 1/4 fuselage assemblies: two joined automatically in series, then two joined manually (in parallel where possible). The table follows the requested columns. Times are in minutes from the plan start (Start Time = 0).

• Total cost = “N/A” overall (resources with unknown cost prevent a complete sum).

## Phase 4. **Validation Report**

- [✓] Completed 4 joints of 1/4 body  
- [✓] Meets all constraints  
- [✓] Shared operations correctly positioned (only one “Jig in,” one “Set up working environment,” one “Jig out”)  
- [✓] The required resources at the current moment do not exceed the total number of resources  

All conditions are satisfied.

is a restatement and brief analysis of all provided constraints:\n\n1. All operations have prerequisites that must be finished first.  \n2. “S40_00001_Jig in” and “S40_01001_Set up working environment” must be the first two operations, and “S40_00002_Jig out” is the final operation of the entire plan. Each is executed only once.  \n3. One 1/4 fuselage joint is completed by either “S40_04012_Deburring int, positioning, attach them automatic” or “S40_04013_Deburring int, positioning, attach them manual,” both of which require their prerequisite chain to be completed first.  \n4. Automatic joint operations can only be carried out in series (one 1/4 body at a time).  \n5. Manual joint operations can be done in series or in parallel—up to two sets at once.  \n6. No manual operation may be done in parallel with any automatic operation, and only the same manual operations can be parallelized. Different manual tasks cannot run concurrently.  \n7. After performing “S40_04014_Deinstall LFT and rails” or “S40_04013_Deburring int, positioning, attach them manual,” the subsequent two steps must be “S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant” followed by “S40_02003_Inspection.”  \n8. If multiple 1/4 bodies are manually jointed (series or parallel), “S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant” and “S40_02003_Inspection” only need to be done once at the end of those manual joints.  \n9. If multiple 1/4 bodies are automatically jointed in series, only one execution of “S40_02001_Set in position Rails and LFT” is needed at the start, and one execution of “S40_04014_Deinstall LFT and rails” is needed at the end of that automatic batch.\n\n### Automatic vs. Manual Quarter Joint Logic\n\n• Automatic Joint Flow (per 1/4 body), minimally:  \n  – (shared start) S40_02001_Set in position Rails and LFT → S40_04001_Camera at stating holes → S40_04012_Deburring int…(auto) → (shared end) S40_04014_Deinstall LFT and rails → then S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant → S40_02003_Inspection.  \n\n• Manual Joint Flow (per 1/4 body), one example chain:  \n  – S40_04003_Drilling template install → S40_04004_Fixation drilling template suite manual → S40_04005_Drilling (with adapter) → S40_04006_Deinstall drilling template → S40_04007_Set in position temporary fastener → S40_04013_Deburring int…(manual) → then at final, S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant → S40_02003_Inspection.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3. **Plan Generation**\n\nBelow is a proposed plan covering four 1/4 fuselage assemblies: two joined automatically in series, then two joined manually (in parallel where possible). The table follows the requested columns. Times are in minutes from the plan start (Start Time = 0).\n\n|Order|Operation                                                    |Type      |Required Resources
