<p class="text-green-500 text-lg"><b>USER: </b></p>
<div class="break-words "><p><strong>Role</strong>: You are an expert in aircraft fuselage assembly planning. Your task is to generate a complete and feasible assembly plan based only on the application ontology and user query.</p>
<p><strong>Query Context:</strong><br/>
User query: {Please help me design a complete aircraft fuselage joint plan that includes four 1/4 bodies, using both automatic and manual methods. Your plan should follow these specific constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each operation depends on preceding operations, which must be completed first.</li>
<li>The first two operations must be &quot;S40_00001_Jig in&quot; and &quot;S40_01001_Set up working environment&quot;, and the last operation must be &quot;S40_00002_Jig out&quot;. They only need to be executed once during the whole joint plan.</li>
<li>&quot;S40_04012_Deburring int, positioning, attach them automatic&quot; or &quot;S40_04013_Deburring int, positioning, attach them manual&quot; is the final operation that completes one 1/4 aircraft fuselage joint, but it has strict prerequisites that must be completed first. Generate a complete process plan for all four 1/4 sections, including all prerequisite operations.</li>
<li>Automatic joint operations can only be performed in series, and only one 1/4 body can be automatically jointed at a time. However, manual joint can be done in series or parallel. At most two sets of manual operations can be carried out in parallel.</li>
<li>Manual and automatic operations cannot be carried out in parallel.</li>
<li>Only the same manual operations can be carried out in parallel. Different manual operations cannot be carried out in parallel.</li>
<li>After &quot;S40_04014_Deinstall LFT and rails&quot; and &quot;S40_04013_Deburring int, positioning, attach them manual&quot;, the next two steps must be: &quot;S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant&quot; then &quot;S40_02003_Inspection&quot;.</li>
<li>If multiple 1/4 bodies are manually jointed in series or parallel, it only needs to execute &quot;S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant&quot; and &quot;S40_02003_Inspection&quot; at the final completion.</li>
<li>If multiple 1/4 bodies are automatically jointed in series, only &quot;S40_02001_Set in position Rails and LFT&quot; needs to be executed first, and &quot;S40_04014-Deinstall LFT and rails&quot; needs to be executed last.}</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Process Requirements</strong>:<br/>
▪ Strictly output according to the following four phase structure, without omitting any part.<br/>
▪ All outputs must be based on data from the application ontology and user query.<br/>
Phase 1. <strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extract ALL operations and resources from the application ontology, show them as a markdown table.</li>
<li>Markdown table format: header row, then separator row |---|---|---|, then data rows.<br/>
For each resource, document:<br/>
▪ Cost (€/h)<br/>
▪ Calendar<br/>
▪ Quantity<br/>
For each operation, document:<br/>
▪ Type (Manual/Automatic)<br/>
▪ Duration (min)<br/>
▪ Required Resources (name (number))<br/>
▪ Total Cost (€)<br/>
▪ Predecessor</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 2. <strong>Constraint Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis and list all constraints.</li>
<li>Analysis and list automatic and manual quarter aircraft fuselage joint logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 3. <strong>Plan Generation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generate a complete aircraft fuselage joint plan table following the Markdown format.</li>
<li>The markdown table headers are: Order; Operation; Type; Required Resources; Duration (min); Start Time (min); End Time (min); Cost (€).</li>
<li>Markdown table format: header row, then separator row |---|---|---|, then data rows.<br/>
Note:<br/>
▪ Order: Use a single number (1, 2, 3, ...) if it is executed sequentially, and use number + letter suffix (4a, 4b, 4c, ...) if it is executed in parallel.<br/>
▪ Operation: Use the full name of operations.<br/>
▪ Type: Use Manual/Automatic.<br/>
▪ Required Resources: Use (name (number)), just like Crane (1), Transportation Tooling (1), ..., and omission or abbreviation is not allowed, such as &#x27;same as above&#x27;.<br/>
▪ Duration (min); Start Time (min); Cost (€): Use number only.<br/>
▪ All content in the table must not be omitted or abbreviated.<br/>
▪ All content in the table cannot include any formatting.<br/>
▪ Only generate one table.</li>
<li>Calculate the total due time and cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 4. <strong>Validation Report</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if the following conditions are met. Mark ✓ if met, and ✗ if not met.<br/>
▪ [✓/✗] Completed 4 joints of 1/4 body<br/>
▪ [✓/✗] Meets all constraints<br/>
▪ [✓/✗] Shared operations correctly positioned<br/>
▪ [✓/✗] The required resources at the current moment do not exceed the total number of resources</li>

<p>Below is a single markdown table consolidating all relevant operations (from the ontology plus those mentioned in the user query) and resources.<br/>

<p>Notes on “Total Cost (€)” and “Predecessor” above:<br/>
• “Calculated at use” indicates that actual total cost depends on how many resources (e.g., Operator(2) in parallel) and the length of usage.<br/>
• Predecessors are context‐dependent and will be specified explicitly in the final plan in Phase 3.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Phase 2. Constraint Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Below is a summary of the key constraints (as stated in the user query), plus the overarching logic for automatic vs. manual quarter‐body joints:</p>
<ol>
<li>Operations have dependencies and must follow their predecessor in correct sequence.</li>
<li>“S40_00001_Jig in” and “S40_01001_Set up working environment” must be the first two operations (only once overall), and “S40_00002_Jig out” must be the last operation (once overall).</li>
<li>Either “S40_04012_Deburring int, positioning, attach them automatic” or “S40_04013_Deburring int, positioning, attach them manual” is the final operation for one 1/4 fuselage section, but each has required prerequisites.</li>
<li>Automatic joint operations can only be done one at a time (strictly in series for each quarter‐body). Manual joint operations can be done in series or parallel, up to two parallel operations at a time, provided they are the same operation.</li>
<li>Manual and automatic operations cannot run in parallel at all.</li>
<li>Only the same manual operation can be parallelized; different manual operations cannot be performed simultaneously.</li>
<li>After finishing “S40_04014_Deinstall LFT and rails” (auto path) or “S40_04013_Deburring int, positioning, attach them manual” (manual path), the next two steps must be “S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant” then “S40_02003_Inspection.”</li>
<li>If multiple 1/4 bodies are manually joined (in series or parallel), “S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant” and “S40_02003_Inspection” are only executed once at the end of that manual batch.</li>
<li>For multiple 1/4 bodies automatically jointed in series, only one “S40_02001_Set in position Rails and LFT” is needed at the start of that automatic run, and one “S40_04014_Deinstall LFT and rails” at the end.</li>
</ol>
<p>Automatic vs. Manual Joint Logic for Four 1/4 Fuselage Sections in This Plan:<br/>
• Two of the quarter fuselage sections will be joined automatically (in series).<br/>
• Two of the quarter fuselage sections will be joined manually (in parallel, since we can do two at a time and they are the same final operation).</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Phase 3. Plan Generation</strong></p>
<p>Below is the complete aircraft fuselage joint plan for four 1/4 bodies (two via the automatic path, two via the manual path), respecting all constraints.<br/>
Only one table is generated. Columns are:<br/>
Order; Operation; Type; Required Resources; Duration (min); Start Time (min); End Time (min); Cost (€).</p>
<p>All times are in minutes from the start (0). Cost is computed from resource cost × (duration in hours). For parallel manual operations with 2 Operators, cost is doubled for that interval.</p>
