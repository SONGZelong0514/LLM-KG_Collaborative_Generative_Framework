I'm sorry, but I'm unable to generate a complete aircraft fuselage joint plan according to your constraints with the given information. The operation details, such as specific numbers for resources and costs, as well as the precedence requirements for all operations, are not fully available in the provided data. Additionally, the complexity of designing a joint plan that incorporates both automatic and manual operations with the specific constraints outlined exceeds the information in the Knowledge Graph and Document Chunks.

### Key Assumptions

- **Manual parallels:** You can execute manual deburring multiple times in different 1/4 sections simultaneously, assuming resource availability.
- **Series execution for automatic tasks:** The automatic deburring operation executes sequentially.
- **Costs Calculation:** Cost is marginally calculated based on available data from resources using operation duration and the sum is expressed across operations.

### Important Notes
- This plan gives one possible scenario, derived from constraints and known data.
- Consider adapting the sequence under operational constraints like resource availability and timing.
- Some detailed resource costs and prerequisites weren't fully accessible from the presented information.
