**Query**: For each resource, search Cost (€/h), Calendar, and Quantity. For each operation, search Type (Manual/Automatic), Duration (min), Required Resources (name (number)), Total Cost (€), and Predecessor.

**Role**: You are an expert in aircraft fuselage assembly planning. Your task is to generate a complete and feasible joint plan that includes four 1/4 bodies, using both automatic and manual methods. Your plan should follow specific constraints.

**constraints**:
1. Each operation depends on preceding operations, which must be completed first.
2. The first two operations must be "S40_00001_Jig in" and "S40_01001_Set up working environment", and the last operation must be "S40_00002_Jig out". They only need to be executed once during the whole joint plan.
3. "S40_04012_Deburring int, positioning, attach them automatic" or "S40_04013_Deburring int, positioning, attach them manual" is the final operation that completes one 1/4 aircraft fuselage joint, but it has strict prerequisites that must be completed first. Generate a complete process plan for all four 1/4 sections, including all prerequisite operations.
4. Automatic joint operations can only be performed in series, and only one 1/4 body can be automatically jointed at a time. However, manual joint can be done in series or parallel. At most two sets of manual operations can be carried out in parallel.
5. Manual and automatic operations cannot be carried out in parallel.
6. Only the same manual operations can be carried out in parallel. Different manual operations cannot be carried out in parallel.
7. After "S40_04014_Deinstall LFT and rails" and "S40_04013_Deburring int, positioning, attach them manual", the next two steps must be: "S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant" then "S40_02003_Inspection".
8. If multiple 1/4 bodies are manually jointed in series or parallel, it only needs to execute "S40_02002_Cleanup and add sealant" and "S40_02003_Inspection" at the final completion.
9. If multiple 1/4 bodies are automatically jointed in series, only "S40_02001_Set in position Rails and LFT" needs to be executed first, and "S40_04014-Deinstall LFT and rails" needs to be executed last.

**Process Requirements**:
▪ Strictly output according to the following four phase structure, without omitting any part.
▪ All outputs must be based on data from the application ontology and user query.
Phase 1. **Data Extraction**  
- Extract ALL operations and resources from the application ontology, show them as a markdown table.
- Markdown table format: header row, then separator row |---|---|---|, then data rows.
For each resource, document:
▪ Cost (€/h)
▪ Calendar
▪ Quantity
For each operation, document:
▪ Type (Manual/Automatic)
▪ Duration (min)
▪ Required Resources (name (number))
▪ Total Cost (€)
▪ Predecessor

Phase 2. **Constraint Analysis**
- Analysis and list all constraints.
- Analysis and list automatic and manual quarter aircraft fuselage joint logic.

Phase 3. **Plan Generation**
- Generate a complete aircraft fuselage joint plan table following the Markdown format.
- The markdown table headers are: Order; Operation; Type; Required Resources; Duration (min); Start Time (min); End Time (min); Cost (€).
- Markdown table format: header row, then separator row |---|---|---|, then data rows.
Note:
▪ Order: Use a single number (1, 2, 3, ...) if it is executed sequentially, and use number + letter suffix (4a, 4b, 4c, ...) if it is executed in parallel.
▪ Operation: Use the full name of operations.
▪ Type: Use Manual/Automatic.
▪ Required Resources: Use (name (number)), just like Crane (1), Transportation Tooling (1), ..., and omission or abbreviation is not allowed, such as 'same as above'.
▪ Duration (min); Start Time (min); Cost (€): Use number only.
▪ All content in the table must not be omitted or abbreviated.
▪ All content in the table cannot include any formatting.
▪ Only generate one table.
- Calculate the total due time and cost.

Phase 4. **Validation Report**:
- Check if the following conditions are met. Mark ✓ if met, and ✗ if not met.
   ▪ [✓/✗] Completed 4 joints of 1/4 body
   ▪ [✓/✗] Meets all constraints
   ▪ [✓/✗] Shared operations correctly positioned
   ▪ [✓/✗] The required resources at the current moment do not exceed the total number of resources
